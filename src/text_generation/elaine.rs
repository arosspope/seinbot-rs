  "What was that?",
  "George, please.",
  "Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.",
  "Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use?",
  "Fighting?",
  "Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.",

  "Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge.",
  "He's always got a truffle or something in there.",
  "You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.",
  "Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.",
  "You asked me to.",
